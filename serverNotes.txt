Here's how I set up basic auth on my VM!

1. created .htpasswd file to store credentials with "sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/.htpasswd admin"
    - Added password for admin
    - Any additions can be made with the above command, without -c
2. Modified /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
    - sudo vi 000-default.conf
    - Added the following tag:
        <Directory "/var/www/html/server">
                AuthType Basic
                AuthName "Restricted Content"
                AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
                Require valid-user
        </Directory>
    - The directory can be whatever, this will contain the restricted files
