------DRAFT 2: THE MIGRAINES-----
Devin Lewis, Ariana Borlak, Charlie Roslansky

-----Abstract-----
Our company is Zereaux Day, a simple calendar app with a login page that allows for password reset, which is vulnerable to email parameter pollution. 
The log file is accessible to an authenticated account and executes any PHP code. 
The server also runs on an outdated Linux kernel version, which is vulnerable to DirtyPipe.


-----Step-by-step walkthrough-----
- Reset password and intercept with Burpsuite to change where the reset link is sent
    - What you get: account login
- Use Burpsuite to inject PHP code into the log file and navigate to it to execute the code
    - What you get: a reverse shell as www-data
- (Potential step if we have time to implement) Find a file containing hashed passwords and crack them
    - What you get: A user with write-permissions
- Clone and run the Dirty Pipe exploit (if you are crazy, write an exploit yourself)
    - What you get: root login

-----Current implementation status-----
At the moment, we have a barebones web server that lets anyone do log poisoning (the current log file is a .php - we should probably figure out how to execute PHP code in arbitrary files). 
We also have the 5.15.5 Linux kernel installed on Ubuntu, allowing for the Dirty Pipe exploit.
We have started working on sending reset emails but are still debugging. We do not yet have password-protected pages or functionality to reset passwords, but have done some trial and error with it so far.

-----Deep-dive topics-----
- Dirty Pipe: we will all try to understand it to whatever degree we can, but it is complicated
- Email servers/parameter pollution: Ariana
- Log files/Log poisoning: Devin
- Authentication (Apache modules and built from scratch): Charlie
