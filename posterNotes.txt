Less space for "what is pentesting"/background - keep it to talking
Work for broad audience - maybe aim for CS 201 students + a couple core courses, leave hooks for more technical discussion
could order boxes with numbers

focus on good diagram
probably don't need to describe too much about preventing the vulns

time-based diagram (attack/info flow) is great
could maybe set the details into the diagram itself
