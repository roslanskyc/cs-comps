This is what I did to set up a credentials databse:

sudo systemctl start postgres

sudo -u postgres psql postgres \\Run postgres

CREATE DATABASE auth;

\c auth \\Connect to auth database, where our table will be stored

CREATE TABLE credentials (
username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE otp (
	code INT UNIQUE,
	account VARCHAR(100)
);

##### Using SQL for auth #####
	Most of the setup is in the files themselves (pg_query_params executes a postgres query with parameters (sanitizing them, hopefully...))

	Here's how to 'protect' the log file, in a terrible, no good, very bad way:
	THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN EVERY TIME THE LOGS GET CLEARED (yeah I know)
		Vim into the log file and stick the following into it:
			`<?php
				session_start();
				if($_SESSION['username'] == NULL) { #Or another check of your choice
					header("Location: ../login.php"); #Or another behavior
					exit();
				}
			?>`
